# 🗺️ Project Roadmap – Virtual Painter (Air Canvas)

This roadmap outlines the planned features and milestones for the **Virtual Painter** project.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Basic (MVP)
- [x] Capture webcam feed with OpenCV
- [x] Detect colored marker using HSV segmentation
- [x] Track marker position with contours
- [x] Draw strokes on screen following marker
- [x] Reset canvas with a key press

---

## 🚀 Phase 2 – Intermediate
- [ ] Add multiple pen colors (switch with keys)
- [ ] Adjustable brush thickness (+ / - keys)
- [ ] Eraser tool (toggle with key or different marker)
- [ ] Save drawing as image (e.g., press `s`)
- [ ] On-screen UI overlay (current color, brush size, instructions)

---

## 🌟 Phase 3 – Advanced
- [ ] Gesture-based controls (hand tracking with Mediapipe)
- [ ] Menu system drawn on screen (hover over color icons to select)
- [ ] Multi-object tracking (draw with two markers simultaneously)
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality
- [ ] Layer support (toggle visibility of strokes)
- [ ] Export as time-lapse video of the drawing process
- [ ] AI-powered mode (e.g., shape recognition, auto-correct lines)

---

## 📌 Long-Term Ideas
- Integrate into AR/VR environments  
- Use with touchless presentations (draw/write in the air)  
- Collaborate online (multi-user air drawing)  

---

## 📅 Timeline (suggested)
- **Week 1** → Phase 1 (Basic MVP complete)  
- **Week 2–3** → Phase 2 (Intermediate features)  
- **Month 1+** → Phase 3 (Advanced portfolio polish)  

---

✨ This roadmap is flexible. You can ship an MVP quickly and keep adding features as you learn.
